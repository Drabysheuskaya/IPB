Final project
(individual or 2-person teams)
Choose a business process - it can be a process in any company or organization known to you, it can be a process based on one of the tasks done during the tutorials. Using appropriate tools create:
a text description of the current business process,
business use case diagram for this process,
BPMN diagram with the current form of this business process. Remember about modelling unusual situations, error handling etc.
Based on this design a new version of the business process, assuming utilization of IT tools to support this process - automation of activities that can be automated etc. Prepare:
BPMN diagram showing the new form of the business process,
Use case diagram (regular, not business) for this business process,
Choose one :
Prototype of application supporting the business process (you can utilize tools such as Bonita BPM or MS Sharepoint), Prototypes of services used by fully or partially automated activities in this process (they don’t have to have full functionality, it is enough if they have the appropriate API and return randomly or based on some condition one of a few prepared results).
Simulation of the two process with comparison what was improved.

The process in its final form should have at least 15 activities in the case of individual projects, 20 in the case of group projects. Not all activities have to be a part of the “main” scenario of this process - this number includes also alternate activities, handling errors and unusual situations etc.
